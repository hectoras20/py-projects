# Data & Actuarial Science Projects Portfolio

This repository contains projects created as part of my preparation for a career in **Data Science and Actuarial Science**.  
The projects are **under active development** and demonstrate practical application of financial and insurance data analysis, modeling, and predictive analytics.

Key skills and techniques applied across the projects include:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for financial and insurance datasets
- **Data preprocessing, cleaning, and error handling**
- **Visualization and presentation of data insights**
- **Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning**
- **Financial and actuarial modeling**
- **Simulation of market and insurance scenarios**
