# University Notes & Quantitative Finance Projects

This repository contains organized university notes and multiple data-driven projects related to finance, actuarial science, and quantitative modeling.  
It aims to demonstrate a solid foundation in applied mathematics, programming, and financial analytics.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **University Notes**
A collection of well-organized notes from various university-level subjects, including:
- Mathematics and Statistics  
- Economics and Finance  
- Computer Science and Data Analysis  

These notes serve both as academic references and as the theoretical foundation behind the financial models developed in this repository.

### 2. **Quantitative Finance Project**
A developing project focused on creating reusable modules for **financial simulation, market data processing, and quantitative model implementation**.

#### **File Categories**
- **`*_class.py`** → Core classes that define reusable financial and statistical structures.  
- **`*_script.py`** → Execution or testing scripts that demonstrate and validate the functionality of classes and models.  
- **`capm.py`** → Main module implementing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and related performance metrics.  
- **`market_data.py`** → Module dedicated to market data handling, cleaning, and transformation for analytical use.  

#### **Supporting Modules**
Contains auxiliary files and helper functions used across different parts of the project.  
These modules enhance modularity and maintainability by handling specific subtasks, such as:
- Data formatting and transformation  
- Utility math functions  
- File handling or configuration management

### 3. **Insurance Annuity Pricing Project**
A new project currently in development that focuses on **life annuity pricing models for retirement products**.

The project aims to:
- Build pricing models for **retirement annuities** based on mortality assumptions and interest rate structures.  
- Integrate **actuarial formulas** and **Monte Carlo simulations** to estimate annuity values and sensitivities.  
- Provide a flexible framework for extending to other insurance and pension products.  


### 4. **Post-COVID Life Expectancy Analysis**
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on life expectancy in a specific region (Guerrero), with the framework designed to be extendable for **all states** in Mexico.

Key aspects:
- Data exploration and cleaning for mortality and population datasets.
- Calculation of life expectancy using Python scripts and statistical methods.
- Results are summarized in Excel for reporting and visualization purposes.
- Designed for reproducibility and extendibility to other states or datasets.

**Note:** The main analysis are done in Python. Excel is used for calculations and final presentation and reporting.

## Development Notes
- The repository is under **active development**.  
- Scripts are gradually being refactored for clarity, modularity, and testing consistency.  
- Future updates will include:
  - Risk modeling modules (VaR, CVaR, Sharpe, etc.)
  - Integration with live market data APIs  
  - Enhanced documentation for each class and function
