    "How do we calculate the present value of something if we know its future value? \n",
    "We take our compound interest equation from the second Markdown cell and rearrange it. We call this \"discounting to present value\" or just \"discounting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Compounding means moving from present value to future value, discounting means moving from future value to present value; they are opposites.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that **when compounding money, a higher interest rate or a longer time period increases the amount our money will grow to.** \n",

    "Their name comes from the fact that they don't pay any intermediate cash-flows called coupons during their life. \n",
    "Zero coupon bonds are a real-world example of present value; **their price is simply the pv of the cash-flow they pay**.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are typically issued for a price below face value, so what you pay for the bond is less than what you receive at maturity. This difference is called the **yield**, which is the annualized percentage return on your investment if you hold the bond to maturity.\n",

    "Let's look at a bond with a three year maturity, face value of one hundred dollars, and yield of three point five percent. What is its price?\n",

    "We use the pv function, and **input the yield as the interest rate**, as well as the number of years and face value of one hundred and get a price of ninety dollars. \n",

    "# 2.2 Coupon Bonds\n",
    "The coupon bond is the most common type of bond in the financial markets. \n",
    "The key difference between the zero coupon bond and the coupon paying bond is that the coupon bond also pays regular cash-flows during its life, called coupons. \n",
    "At maturity, the bond pays a coupon as well as its face value, which is typically set to one hundred dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coupons are usually paid once or twice per year, and the number of coupons paid per year is called **the frequency**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**KEY: The yield to maturity is the annual return an investor makes if they buy the bond at the current market price and hold it until maturity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example now. \n",
    "Consider a coupon bond with a maturity of three years that pays a three **percent annual coupon**, has a face value of one hundred dollars, and yield to maturity of four percent. Its cash flows will look like this: \n",
    "Each year we will get paid a three dollar coupon, except in the last year where we get paid both a coupon and the one hundred dollar face value. \n",
    "**Note that the cash flow paid each period is the coupon in percent multiplied by the face value.**\n",
    "**These values are all fixed in advance and don't change!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how a coupon bond can be broken up into a series of zero coupon bonds. \n",
    "Since we know how to price a zero coupon bond, we find the pv of each cash-flow, as if it were its own zero coupon bond, and add all these pvs together to get the price of the coupon bond. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same coupon bond from earlier, we break up its cash-flows into three zero coupon bonds, each with a face value equal to the cash-flow.\n",
    " The first two bonds will represent the coupons of three dollars, and the third bond will represent the coupon of three dollars and face value of one hundred dollars. Then we price these three zero coupon bonds in the same way as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using our compound interest formula**, the one year zero coupon bond will have a pv of two dollars and eighty eight cents, the two year zero coupon bond will have a pv of two dollars and seventy seven cents, and the three year zero coupon bond will have a pv of ninety one dollars and fifty seven cents. Adding these together gives a price of ninety seven dollars and twenty two cents.\n",
    "Notice:\n",
    "* We will use the yield percentage\n",
    "* 1st - 3/(1.04)**1 = 2.88\n",
    "* 2nd - 3/(1.04)**2 = 2.77\n",
    "* 3th - 3/(1.04)**3 = 91.57\n",
    "* The sum of clash flows is equals to the pv of the bond!\n",
    "* pv of the bond = (fv + n (fv * 0.04)) / (1+ 0.03 * n) = 97.3214\n",
    "\n",
    "So our formula for a coupon bond is just a sum of zero coupon bonds, where C is the coupon paid in each time period, *r is the yield to maturity* of the bond, P is the face value (or principal) paid at maturity, and n is the number of time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price = PV = ( Sum_{i=1}^{n} Coupon / (1+r)^i) + P(fv)/(1+r)^n**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Only do not forget that at the maturity point, you will recieve the face amount + a coupond, and we will deal them separately, the couponds + fv*\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the pv function can do this entire process for us in just one step. \n",
    "Taking the same bond, we set the rate as the bond yield, nper as the number of years, pmt as the coupon, and fv as the principal paid at maturity, and get the same price. As the bond is paying us a coupon, pmt is now positive. We also put a minus sign before the function to get a positive number for the price. \n",
    "Also note that the npf dot pv function deals with the coupons and face value separately, so we set the fv to one hundred, not one hundred and three."

    "Bond yields in the financial markets can vary substantially over time, driven by various factors such as central bank interest rates and inflation expectations. \n",

    "\n",
    "Lets plot a graph of bond prices against yields to understand the relationship better. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the packages numpy, numpy financial, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot. \n",
    "Next, we create an array of bond yields using the numpy arange function, which takes as its inputs the starting value, ending value, and step increments. \n",
    "This will create an array of values from zero to twenty (not inclusive) in steps of zero-point-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we convert this array into a pandas DataFrame using the pd-dot-DataFrame function and give this column the title \"bond yield\" using the argument columns, which is passed into the function as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we add a second column to the DataFrame called bond price. \n",
    "Each row in this column will take the yield in that row and use it to calculate the price of a bond with that level of yield. \n",
    "For this example, we have chosen a ten year bond with a coupon of five percent (annual coupond percentage/interest) inside our pv function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we use the plt dot plot function to plot our graph with bond yield on the x-axis and bond price on the y-axis.\n",
    "The graph shows the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields that we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that prices move inversely to yields. \n",
    "\n",
    "One intuition for this is that increasing the yield **means you apply a higher discount rate to each cash-flow of the bond, reducing their pv. As the bond price is the sum of these pv's, the bond price decreases.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**KEY: YIELD RELATED WITH DISCOUNT**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about it is that since the **cash-flows are fixed** (REMEMBER THAT THE PERIOD, ANNUAL COUPON INTERES AND FACE VALUE ARE FIXED!), **paying a higher price for the same set of cash flows means the return on your investment (the yield to maturity), must be lower**.\n",
    "In other words, since the cash flows are fixed and while you are paying more for the bond... the percentage of return (yield) must be lower, while the price decrease the percentage return increase.\n",

This can be very useful when comparing different bonds, each with different prices, coupons, and maturities, in order to see which bond offers us the greatest return on our investment.\n",

    "## Zero Coupon Bond\n",
    "Lets take our formula for the price of zero coupon bond from the first lesson of this chapter. \n",

    "The zero coupon bond has a three year maturity, a face value of one hundred dollars, and price of ninety dollars and nineteen cents. \n",
    "What is its yield?\n",
    "Using our formula in Python, we set ytm to be the future value divided by the present value to the nth root, where n is the number of years, minus one. \n",

    "The easiest way to represent the nth root in Python is to simply raise it to the power of one divided by n. \n",

    "# 3.1 Duration - The sensitivity of bonds to interest\n",
    "Let's examine the sensitivity of bonds to interest rates in more detail.\n",
    "So far, we have seen that prices and yields move inversely *(since we fix the annual coupon... if we have a high price the yield will be low... high price + small coupons the yield that is the sum of all will be lower, near to the price in one sense)*; the lower the price of a bond, the higher its yield. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What we don't yet know* is **how sensitive a particular bond is to interest rates**. \n",
    "Different bonds will have a different sensitivity to interest rates; the same change in interest rates will affect different bonds differently. \n",
    "**Duration is a measure of interest rate risk that helps us to quantify this sensitivity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To see an example of this, let's consider a five year bond and a ten year bond, both paying a five percent annual coupon. \n",
    "If interest rates are at five percent, then they will both have a price of one hundred since their coupon rate equals the yield. \n",
    "Pricing each bond using the pv function confirms this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move interest rates up to six percent and price the same two bonds using this higher level of interest rates. By comparing the new prices of these bonds to their old prices of one hundred each, we can see that the five year bond lost four point two one percent of its value, while the ten year bond lost seven point three six percent of its value. \n",
    "**The price of the bond will be affected.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the ten year bond lost more of its value than the five year bond for the same change in interest rates; **(key) the ten year bond was more sensitive to interest rate changes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**So this is usefull when we know that bonds are affected to the rates modified by FED** for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways of defining duration. \n",
    "**In this course, we define duration as the percentage price change of a bond for a one percentage point change in interest rates.** \n",
    "**Higher duration means higher interest rate risk, since in other words, the percentage of change (duration) is high.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use of this metric\n",
    "Duration is used by traders and investors to help assess the interest rate risk of a bond or portfolio of bonds, hedge this interest rate risk, or predict how much money will be made or lost for a given change in interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the formula for duration is quite complicated, in this course, we will use a simplified version. \n",
    "We calculate duration by pricing a bond at both a one percent higher and lower level of interest rates, *and divide this by two times* the original price of the bond *times* the amount we shifted interest rates by. \n",
    "This gives us an approximate estimate for how much bond prices will change for a one percent change in yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "duration = (price_down - price_up) / (prices * 2 * 0.01)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's look at an example by taking a ten year bond with a five percent annual coupon and four percent yield. \n",
    "We want to calculate its duration using the formula from the previous slide. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we find the price of the bond in the usual way and assign the result to the variable 'price'. \n",
    "Next, we find the price of the same bond for a one percent higher and lower level of yields, and assign the results to 'price up' and 'price down', respectively. \n",
    "Finally, we use our duration formula along with our assigned variables, and print the result. We get a result of seven point seven four, meaning that for a one percent change in yields, the price of our bond will change by approximately seven point seven four percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary...\n",
    "* Different bonds can behave differently for the same change in yields because they have different levels of interest rate sensitivity. \n",
    "* **Duration is the percentage price change of a bond for a one percent change in yields**, and it is used to measure this interest rate sensitivity."

    "# 3.2 Factors affecting duration\n",
    "Now let's look at the factors affecting duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration can also be thought of as the 'average' time to get your money back. The longer you wait to get your money back, for example, if a bond has a long time to maturity, the more exposed you are to changes in interest rates, hence the duration is higher.\n",
    "3. Duration as the slope of the tangent line\n",
    "00:20 - 00:48\n",
    "The technical definition of duration is that it is the derivative of price with respect to yield; this is how you find the actual formula for duration. This means duration is the slope of the tangent line on the price versus yield plot. To find the duration of a twenty year bond with a five percent coupon, and price of one hundred dollars, we can find its yield, then drawing a tangent line and taking the slope gives us its duration.\n",
    "4. Maturity vs. duration\n",
    "00:48 - 01:03\n",
    "If a bond has a longer maturity, we will need to wait longer to recoup the original bond price. This leaves us exposed to changes in interest rates for a longer period of time, hence a bond with a higher maturity will have a higher duration.\n",
    "5. Coupon rate vs. duration\n",
    "01:03 - 01:24\n",
    "In a similar way, the higher the coupon on a bond, the quicker we start getting our money back. This means we are less exposed to changes in interest rates during the life of the bond, and hence the duration of the bond is lower when the coupon is higher. This means a bond paying no coupons at all, such as a zero coupon bond, has a higher duration.\n",
    "6. Bond yield vs. duration\n",
    "01:24 - 01:47\n",
    "Finally, let's consider the effect of bond yields on duration by plotting a graph of bond prices against yields to see where the curve is steepest. As duration is the slope of the tangent line at that point, we can see that when yields are lower, the curve is steeper, and so duration is higher. Hence bonds with lower yields have a higher duration.\n",
    "7. Ways of investigating duration\n",
    "01:47 - 02:15\n",
    "There are a few ways to investigate the effect of maturity, coupons, and yields on duration. One way is to find the duration of two bonds where we change one of these factors and see which bond has the higher duration, as we did in the previous set of exercises. We can also plot a line graph of prices against yields like we did in the previous chapter. Finally, we can plot a graph of duration against the factor in question, which we will do now.\n",
    "8. Plotting bond maturity against duration\n",
    "02:15 - 02:51\n",
    "Say we want to plot a graph of bond maturity against duration. Similar to how we plotted our graph of prices against yields, we begin by importing the relevant packages. Next, we create a numpy array of bond maturities up to 30 years using the np-dot-arange function. Then we store this in a pandas DataFrame with the column header \"bond maturity.\" Then we calculate \"price up\", \"price down\", and \"duration\" in the same way that we did in the previous video, only this time we assign the result to columns in our DataFrame.\n",
    "9. Plotting bond maturity against duration\n",
    "02:51 - 03:09\n",
    "Finally, we use the plt-dot-plot function to plot bond maturity on the x-axis and bond duration on the y-axis, add labels for both axes as well as a title, and show the graph. As we saw earlier, the longer the maturity, the higher the duration.\n",
    "10. Summary\n",
    "03:09 - 03:20\n",
    "To summarize, the duration of a bond will increase when it has a longer time to maturity, pays a lower (or even zero) coupon, or has a lower yield."
